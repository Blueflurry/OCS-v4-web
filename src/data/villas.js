            "Close to the banks of the Mandovi River, Belas Casas is an elegant two-storey villa in the north Goan village of Reis Magos. Great for hosting large groups, there stands a grand entrance to welcome you. Nestled atop a hill, the villa’s wood-decked balconies are the perfect place to sip wine, gazing at immersive views of the river as it merges into the sea. \r\n\r\nSpend a relaxing afternoon in one of the five ensuite bedrooms as the sun lights up their soft pastel shades. Enjoy a scrumptious breakfast spread on the patio or unwind at the private pool. Make the most of your time with family and friends over a game of cards and endless chatter in one of the two cosy living rooms.\r\n\r\nFeel your feet sink into the grass of the villa's garden and watch the sun setting over Goa’s magnificent horizon. With Lohono’s impeccable service and concierge, hike to the popular Reis Magos fort or visit the enchanting Reis Magos church. Plan a trip to the capital city of Panjim or simply sink into the comforts of Belas Casas.",

            "Watching the birds glide across the horizon from the sun-kissed balcony and rippling pool of this charming villa in North Goa is a moment to treasure.\r\n\r\nDespite its proximity to the vibrant beaches and popular Goan restaurants, the Regato remains secluded, surrounded by fields and farms. Here, only nature's chatter breaks the silence, providing a haven of peace and serenity.\r\n\r\nStep inside this charming abode, where chic aesthetic stripes and touches of plush colour welcome you. The warmth of wood and elegant maritime artefacts evoke the coastal charm, reminding you that the sea is never far away. The tasteful dining area invites you to indulge in Lohono’s in-house feasts, while the shady gazebo area offers a serene spot for quiet reflection with a good book.\r\n\r\nThe interior exudes a gloriously muted ambiance, with rustic touches and exposed wood in the serene bedrooms perfectly echoing the laid-back charms of Goan villa life.\r\n\r\nWhen the urge to explore strikes, follow ancient paths to Vagator beach, just a 20-minute drive away. Venture to the sleepy village of Assagao to savour culinary delights at Bawri or Gunpowder, or head a bit further to Anjuna, a 20-minute drive, where charming café bars, shops, and yacht hirers await, promising an afternoon well spent along the glistening bays.",

            "Introducing Panache Homes, an embodiment of refined elegance nestled in the heart of Goa. While constructed in a gated community, each residence stands out as a beacon of spaciousness and brightness. Gone is the often-felt claustrophobia of compact homes; instead, here every room bathes in an abundance of natural light, ensuring no corner remains untouched by the sun's warmth.At Panache, nature isn’t just a distant view; it's an intimate experience. With every step, you'll feel as if you're transitioning from a plush living room straight into the embrace of fields or beneath the canopy of a tree. Large glass facades not only add to the villa's aesthetic appeal but offer undisturbed views of the verdant fields and a mesmerizing infinity pool.While many resorts or villas might boast of their seclusion, cocooned amidst dense forests, Panache offers something unique. Here, while you’re ensconced in luxury, you're never truly cut off. A charming chapel nearby, the melodic calls of peacocks, and the uninterrupted field views ensure you're always connected to Goa's vibrant life.",

            "Derived from the word ‘castle’, Castello Villa 6 celebrates the unification of modern and timeless design. Part of the Castello villa community in Assagaon, the home seamlessly weaves together traditional Mediterranean architecture with modern, world-class amenities. \r\n\r\nThe stunning living and dining room opens up into a beautiful pool area, perfect for relaxing with a chilled cocktail in hand, while taking in the lush green views. The four gorgeous ensuite-bedrooms include a master suite that comes with a private sit-out. The cozy terrace on the second floor will allow you to make the most of balmy Goan evenings and is ideal for hosting an intimate soirée. Focus on work or unwind with a book in the study, or don the chef’s hat in the fully equipped kitchen. And if you’d like to step out and explore or indulge in some of our unique in-villa experiences, Lohono’s guest relations and concierge teams will be at hand with the best recommendations and thoughtful assistance. \r\n\r\nSecluded yet thriving, Assagaon has it all. Its leafy streets, lush fields and nearby pristine beaches are where you can stop and catch a breath before heading off to one of its popular restaurants for a thumping night of fun.",

            "Traditional Goan tiled roofs combine with a distinctive Greek style and Cape Dutch influences at  Silvio Villa D. Part of an Isprava-built gated community in the heart of Assagaon, the two-storied home comprises 4 ensuite bedrooms that are defined by minimalist colours and silhouettes. Botanical murals and coloured prints bring to life the balance between the tropical colonial style and boho chic aesthetics in the living and dining area. The private pool and adjoining sit-out are ideal for fun times with the family, while the terrace bar is where you can raise a glass with your confidants.\r\n\r\nSilvio is truly a haven for city-dwellers. No two luxury homes here are alike and yet they maintain a beautiful sense of harmony. You can book multiple villas in the community for larger groups, while enjoying the privacy within your own villa. Conveniently located in Assagaon, Goa’s trendiest cafés and restaurants are right at your doorstep while the pristine beaches of Ashvem and Mandrem are just a short drive away.",

            "Welcome to lakehouse living in Goa. Estate De Alta Palmeira roughly translates to ‘tall palm trees estate’. Nestled amid swaying palms and overlooking Chapora River, the bright yellow villa is the quintessential spot for a fun-filled holiday. The main building has two levels and houses the living area, dining area, four bedrooms, and a Den. There’s also a two-storied Outhouse, which comprises a spa and one bedroom. The connecting passage contains a powder room and kitchen. Bask in the afternoon sun by the lawns or swim under the palm shadows in the open-air pool. Spend balmy evenings reading in the armchairs overlooking the river. The cosy interiors are a modern take on traditional Goan villas, while the patios are the perfect place to listen to birdsong and rustling leaves. Estate Alta De Palmeira’s thoughtful details, patterned floors and arched walkways are an invitation to slow days and long conversations over wine or a cocktail.\r\n\r\nExperience the vibrant culture and people of Goa with Lohono. Our villas in North and South Goa are perfectly placed to explore the neighbourhoods of Assagaon, Mandrem, Saipe, Siolim, Reis Magos, Moira, Nagoa, Bastora, Chapora, Anjuna, Dona Paula and beyond. Make the most of Goa’s unique street shops, restaurants and creative local talent while you enjoy the warm hospitality of our villa teams. And you’re always close to a beach, for an unlimited fill of the sun, sand and waves.",

            "Watching the birds glide across the horizon from the sun-kissed balcony and rippling pool of this charming villa in North Goa is a moment to treasure.\r\n\r\nDespite its proximity to the vibrant beaches and popular Goan restaurants, the Regato remains secluded, surrounded by fields and farms. Here, only nature's chatter breaks the silence, providing a haven of peace and serenity.\r\n\r\nStep inside this charming abode, where chic aesthetic stripes and touches of plush colour welcome you. The warmth of wood and elegant maritime artefacts evoke the coastal charm, reminding you that the sea is never far away. The tasteful dining area invites you to indulge in Lohono’s in-house feasts, while the shady gazebo area offers a serene spot for quiet reflection with a good book.\r\n\r\nThe interior exudes a gloriously muted ambiance, with rustic touches and exposed wood in the serene bedrooms perfectly echoing the laid-back charms of Goan villa life.\r\n\r\nWhen the urge to explore strikes, follow ancient paths to Vagator beach, just a 20-minute drive away. Venture to the sleepy village of Assagao to savour culinary delights at Bawri or Gunpowder, or head a bit further to Anjuna, a 20-minute drive, where charming café bars, shops, and yacht hirers await, promising an afternoon well spent along the glistening bays.",

The dining area that opens out onto the private pool area, is perfect for a dinner soirée while the terrace, fitted with its own bar, is where you can enjoy your aperitifs. The 3 cozy bedrooms and den offer homely comforts and the best amenities for you to relax and unwind. \r\n\r\nColina is truly a haven for city-dwellers. No two luxury homes here are alike and yet they maintain a beautiful sense of harmony.

Conveniently located in Assagaon, Goa’s trendiest cafés and restaurants are right at your doorstep while the pristine beaches of Ashvem and Mandrem are just a short drive away.",

            "Mirroring the contour of the hills, the two-storied Monforte Villa E is laid out across gently descending levels. Full-length windows flood the living and dining area with natural light while sweeping arches frame the passages. Designed with Mediterranean elements and a dramatic yet monochromatic colour palette, Villa E has a quintessential beach holiday-home vibe. The three ensuite bedrooms strike the perfect balance between luxury and comfort with their contemporary chic aesthetic. The pool area is perfect for fun mornings with the kids, while the cozy terrace with a semi-covered seating area and bar, is the ideal spot to unwind after an exciting day.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing a gated community, large groups can easily be accommodated across multiple Monforte villas, giving you the chance to mingle, while still offering you the privacy of your own space when you want to simply unwind. And if you’d like to explore, Assagaon has it all—peaceful churches and colourful Portuguese mansions to quaint little cafés and busy shops. Whether you want to go sight-seeing or beach hopping, rent a car or crave a lavish home cooked meal, Lohono’s hospitality and concierge teams will provide you all the assistance, and ensure your stay is as carefree as possible.",

            "The essence of Colina - Villa A is best described as bright, bold and blissful. With an unmissable nautical and Mediterranean vibe, this comfortable two-storied  home is dotted with distressed, vintage furniture that complements the colourful, plush furnishings. The sparkling blue private pool is flanked by dense greenery on one side and a chic bar on the other. The spacious living and dining area is ideal for a soirée with family and friends while the terrace is well-suited for a more intimate gathering. Unwind at any time in the three tastefully decorated bedrooms or the cozy den.\r\n\r\nMore than just a gated community, Isprava-built Colina is a haven for city-dwellers. No two luxury homes here are alike and yet they maintain a beautiful sense of harmony. You can book multiple villas in the community for larger groups, while enjoying the privacy within your own villa. Conveniently located in Assagaon, Goa’s trendiest cafés and restaurants are right at your doorstep while the pristine beaches of Ashvem and Mandrem are just a short drive away.",

            "Igreha is a gated community in Goa, tucked away in the hip neighbourhood of Siolim village. The villas here have thick, cream walls, high ceilings and idiosyncratic tiles. While some homes feature ancient Banyan trees others boast of glamorous poolside decks that lend themselves to endless afternoons of G&Ts and good music.\r\nIgreha Villa D is surrounded by lush foliage which feels deeply restorative. During summers, you can see the tempting vermilion and golden hues of ripened mangoes dangling from the trees. In the spring, you can smell the aroma of fermenting cashew fruit on its way to becoming the locally made urak (also known as Goa’s Jungle Juice).",

While some homes feature ancient Banyan trees others boast of glamorous poolside decks that lend themselves to endless afternoons of G&Ts and good music.\r\nIgreha Villa A is surrounded by lush foliage which feels deeply restorative. During summers, you can see the tempting vermilion and golden hues of ripened mangoes dangling from the trees. In the spring, you can smell the aroma of fermenting cashew fruit on its way to becoming the locally made urak (also known as Goa’s Jungle Juice).",

            "It is always summer at Villa Fairview that offers the magic of Goa without the tourists and noise. Located amidst a sea of green in Assagao, the four bedroom house has an infinity pool with a patio-bar area right beside it with an incredibly lush view of greens, almost forest-like. The grey and black elements that are incorporated into this Portuguese style home visually beckon your attention. The dining room is fun and quirky with pink printed wallpaper and modern comfortable furnishings. The house follows a combination of black and white tiling that accentuates the interiors of the space. Each room is awarded a different tile-design which follows the black and white colour combination. For those seeking rest and relaxation, the pool is the best place to be with a book or a drink in hand. This stylish villa demands you let go in every way possible, and demands you and your senses to be pampered effortlessly.Enjoy Amazing Food!undefined",

Clean and elegant, the colour palette of the house is immersed in whites, orange, cream, blues and green. Amore is a tasteful combination of contemporary interiors furnished with modern furniture and some eclectic wallpapers. The kitchen is light and airy that follows a pistachio colour scheme. The bathrooms are a sight for sore eyes that provided a pop of colour with blue and green hues. The tiling around the house is exquisite and faultless. Step out onto the patio for views of unmarred greens and escape the world, even for a few days with the peace and beauty that surrounds you.Enjoy awesome food!undefined",

            "Moonhouse as the name suggests is immersed in shades of black and grey that rises out of the greenery of Siolim, Goa. A geometrically pleasing structure, this villa is all about bold lines, strong colours, soft lighting and a modern aesthetic. The four bedroom house looks like it has been built around the pool that has a unique and distinct shape to it. All aspects of the house are custom made to evoke feelings and moods of the moon, especially the double-heighted living room which boasts a chandelier that comprises 46 globes of different sizes, suspended from the ceiling at different heights to give a sense of lightness to the room. The enchanting space has several walkways and bridges, each bedroom and bathroom has been tastefully designed. The master bedroom holds a surprise, a private staircase that connects the room to a private-sit out. The house is engulfed with natural light and the open kitchen design ensures every part of the house spills over to the next seamlessly. The living space opens up to a beautifully appointed bar room that leads to an outdoor sitting space by the pool. Each area and room of the Moonhouse offers a sense of excitement and ensures your stay is never dull or boring.Enjoy Amazing Food!undefined",

            "Banyan trees, palm groves and glorious frangipanis—a stunning natural environment harmoniously fused with awe-inspiring grandeur. Welcome to Isprava’s Estate de Frangipani. Influenced by Portuguese architecture styles, sweeping arches, muted earthy tones and plush furnishings accentuate the breathtaking interiors. Outdoors, the expansive lawn, yoga deck, glasshouse and swimming pool are set against the lush backdrop of the Assagaon fields. The covered courtyard is an ideal place to lounge and spot peacocks before the monsoon or even monkeys swinging between trees. \r\n\r\nDefined by its double-height ceiling, the chic living room is a great place to spend quality time with loved ones, before you devour a sumptuous meal in the dining room. Immerse yourself in the luxury and comfort of the four ensuite bedrooms, binge-watch your favourite shows in the entertainment room and curl up with a book in the study. Fitness enthusiasts can make the most of the private gym and steam room or get in some laps in the large swimming pool. Head to the terrace to watch the sky put on a show at sunset and pop a bottle of bubbly in celebration of your well-deserved holiday.",

The villa is located amidst a quiet village in Anjuna and is the ideal location for a large family to stay together. The villa consists of five Spanish style bedrooms and the house itself is arranged in several internally linked wings that extend from and around the central foyer and a staircase. The gorgeous balconies that surround the house have been designed to allow one to step out from their rooms and enjoy the breath-taking views that peek through veils of bougainvillea’s in bloom. The living room is adorned with a stunning high ceiling with wood beams, creating an ambience that is light and airy with doors that lead straight onto the patio and pool area. The living room is one of the best places to lounge around or entertain. The design of the house follow a predominately vintage-style of architecture. The white stucco exterior of the villa results in an aged-looking old world surface. This rustic yet modern Villa exudes impeccable class and style.Enjoy awesome food!undefined",

            "A stay at Casa Solareiga is all about perfect sunsets on the expansive terrace surrounded by lush foliage, and lazy afternoons drifting in the gorgeous private pool complete with an inset jacuzzi. Solariega is located amidst a quiet village in Anjuna and is the ideal location for a large family to stay together. It's also just 5 minutes' drive from lifestyle stores and boutique eateries. The living room is adorned with a stunning high ceiling with wood beams, eclectic art and is in colours that reflects the Greek Isles. A place to relax with a drink and take in all the moments of good life. Dine in style with culinary delights put together by the in-house chef and rock to your favourite music at the bar at the other end. The place consists of five Spanish style bedrooms and the house itself is arranged in several internally linked wings that extend from and around the central foyer and a staircase. The gorgeous balconies that surround the house have been designed to allow one to step out from their rooms and enjoy the breath-taking views that peek through veils of bougainvillaea in bloom. The design of the house follows a predominately vintage-style of architecture. The white stucco exterior of the villa results in an aged-looking old world surface. This rustic yet modern property exudes impeccable class and style.undefined",

            "Epitomising the very definition of luxury, Villa Eternia is a seven bedroom property sprawled upon a hill with expansive views of the Goan river. The glass windows are consistent across the entire property and seamlessly lets the outdoors in, while retaining its privacy. A design masterpiece, each room within the space is fashioned with a distinct elegance and calmness that defines Goa. Inspired by modern opulence, the generous space features high-end furnishings. The private infinity pool is customised to ensure you experience the elements of water that surround you bringing forth a burst of pristine clear blue water that allows you to unwind and relax. The interiors of the villa are clean, refined and a modern facade. The property has an inviting aesthetic attributed to its neutral colour scheme for soft furnishing with sleek marble tiling that blends in with the landscape. The living and dining spaces are on the ground floor and the bedrooms are clustered between the ground and first level. The mastery of the textures and colours used in the rooms till the pool and garden  seem to offer the best of both worlds. The openness of the space embraces on with an almost freeing emotion, where your soul is completely satisfied with the beauty it is experiencing.Enjoy Amazing Food!undefined",
