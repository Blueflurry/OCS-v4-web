            "Nestled amidst the soothing scent of bougainvillaea, this serene, whitewashed sanctuary offers a refreshingly discreet escape from the cityâ€™s routine life. Villa Santorini, resembling a dreamy white cottage tucked away in the lanes of Greece, has been thoughtfully designed to dance with the gentle caress of the breeze.\r\n\r\nAs you glide through the arched doorway, you will find yourself in a spacious living room, flanking the open kitchenette with only the most beautiful cerulean countertop that echoes the charm of a quaint diner you might find in the bylanes of the Cyclades islands. \r\n\r\nFrom here, French doors beckon you to the pool area, where, as the sun begins its descent, the shadows of towering palm trees cascade upon the water, offering the perfect summer retreat.\r\n\r\nTake a dip in the pool or recline on the plush loungers or in the gazebo, where gentle breezes sway amidst comfortable seating. Ascend the Santorini-inspired stairs to discover the second wing of this Greek paradise, where a BBQ sit-out and bar area await. The bar, adorned with a cage-like structure and a blue-iron door, adds a touch of drama to the space. As evening falls, find yourself drawn to this bar, relishing in scrumptious barbecues beneath the soft glow of fairy lights, engaging in sweet conversations with loved ones.\r\n\r\nA few steps further lead to the dining room, adorned with artefacts that seamlessly blend with the villa's aesthetic. The bedrooms, luxurious and ethereal, offer cloud-like beds that promise restful slumber, only to wake up to views that can only be described as magical.\r\n\r\nThis villa in Alibaug invites you to immerse yourself in its tranquil ambiance, where every corner whispers tales of Greek charm and timeless elegance.",

            "Embark on a spiritual journey at Casa Del. Tucked away amid swaying palms in Alibaug, the villa is an invitation to think deeply. Architect Pinakin Patel uses clean lines and soft curves to craft contemplative spaces that let you breathe. The five ensuite bedrooms are minimally decorated with elegant pieces and statement artwork. The Dholpur red stone colours the entire villa in a shade that is both soothing and inspiring. Enjoy a meditative day as sunlight and birdsong bathe the villa, which by night transforms into a dynamic space brought alive by the evening lights. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExclusively brought to you by Lohono, Casa Del is a tranquil getaway from city living. Stroll under the picturesque arches and exchange stories on the chessboard floors. Dip into the heated pool as you soak in the lush horizon and endless blue sky. A stay at Casa Del will open you up to endless possibilities.",

            "Built on the tenets of California Modernism, Greystone Manor, located in Awas, Alibaug, is a grand 5-bedroom villa that gracefully blurs the boundaries between indoors and outdoors. The transparent glass panels and the clever layout, centered around the pool, encourage interaction and spending time with loved ones. The colourful Bohemian decor strikingly contrasts the grey coloured exterior which echoes the indigenous rocks. For an intimate gathering with friends, the outdoor bar and seating areas will make the perfect setting, while the expansive lawns and dedicated games room will make for an unforgettable holiday with the family.",

            "Unearth the spirit of Bali in Alibaug. The Ray is an extension of its rich natural surroundings, inviting you to connect with yourself and your loved ones. Itâ€™s named after the the Manta Rays that were once found in the Arabian Sea near Alibaug, and the warm sun rays that the east-facing villa receives. Built into two levels, the five bedrooms have their own entrances. Let the birds and a large mosaic manta ray welcome you into the lower level living room. With floor-to-ceiling windows on three sides, the expansive room has a well-manicured garden and the blue sky for walls. Walk further into the pool lounge, which is surrounded by a glistening pool open to the valley. \r\n\r\n\r\nAt The Ray, spaces seamlessly blend into each other. The harmonious balance expands with the use natural materials in the decor: stone walls, sand and tropical foliage. Asian-inspired elements like totem poles for luck, traditional grinders repurposed as pots and art bring the outdoors in. Logs of wood are used as benches; the tables are large pieces of granite and stone, and crystals lamps lend warmth to an evening of conversations. In a poetic gesture, the rocks that were once part of the original mountain have a home in the villa.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nThe Ray is full of mysteries that will bring your childhood alive. Soak in the stunning infinity pool as the young ones splash about the lower pool with a slide. Feel the crisp grass on your toes, swing away in the lounge area or explore the secret doorways. Feel your worries melt away in the bar, or unwind with a movie or games. Stroll through the property to find picture-perfect corners and plants that have been largely grown in-house. Get cosy with your loved ones in the dining room as our villa team serves a delicious spread. The stunning living room chandeliers are crafted using hand-moulded glass, reflecting the morning sun and shining bright as stars in the night.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecome one with nature at The Ray. Escape the city to come home to thoughtful hospitality and specially crafted experiences. Explore the beaches, quaint markets and local culture of Alibaug with Lohono.",
